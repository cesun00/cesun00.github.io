Data strobe encoding does the same with an extra line strobe, and provide jitter tolerance and clock recovery.
data as before is trasmitted as-is. Level of strobe is flipped only if 2 consecutive data bits are the same. consequence:
data can be verified by looking at strobe data XOR strobe recovers the clock square wave Surface-mount technology (SMT) The technique to install chips on the surface of a PCB, instead of the old way (known as through-hole technology) of penetrating the PCB for holes with metal contacts.</description></item><item><title>Memorandum: Transistors</title><link>https://cesun.info/ee/transistors/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cesun.info/ee/transistors/</guid><description>A transistor is just a variable resistor whose resistance is adjustable not by hand but by electricity.
A transistor is any device with 3 (or more - see below) terminals where the voltage (thus current) between one pair of terminals controls the current (thus effective resistance) flowing through another pair of terminals. This nice controllability allows a transistor to be used as a switch of current, turned on and off also by electricity.</description></item><item><title>A Simple Electric Physics Primer</title><link>https://cesun.info/ee/physics-primer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cesun.info/ee/physics-primer/</guid><description>resistor / resistance &amp;amp; conductance resistance measures an object&amp;rsquo;s opposition to the flow of current through it. conductance is the reciprocal of resistance. (unit: mho â„§) The electrical component that provides resistance is called a resistor.
inductor / inductance When the current (strength) through an object changes (e.g. in an AC circuit), inductance measures the object&amp;rsquo;s ability to oppose such change. Unit of inductance is henry (H). Customary symbol for inductance is L.</description></item></channel></rss>
