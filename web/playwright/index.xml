The central idea is to increase page rendering performance by avoid creating each node for each data item. Virtualized list keeps a few DOM nodes (most commonly &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;) only enough to fill its viewport, and change the content of those DOM nodes by inspecting location of slide of the scrollbar when scroll event is fired.</description></item></channel></rss>
