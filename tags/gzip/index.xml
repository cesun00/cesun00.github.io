Specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s an abuse to refer to DEFLATE as a compression algorithm.
The DEFLATE data format was designed Phil Katz, for version 2 of his PKZIP archiving tool, and later standardized as the RFC 1951.
The most popular and de-facto standard DEFLATE library is the zlib.
Overview A DEFLATE formatted file consists of a sequence of blocks. Each block is comprised of 2 parts: a description of a Huffman tree, followed by the actual compressed data.</description></item></channel></rss>
