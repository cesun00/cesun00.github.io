Naming Unit:
GT/s: gigatransfer per seconds, i.e. billion or 10^9 MT/s: megatransfer per seconds, i.e. million or 10^6 DDR4-2666 means a DDR4 SDRAM chip is around 2666.67 MT/s.
Most commercial MM mounts 8 x8 chips per rank in order to provide a 64 bit global data bus. If the chip mounted is DDR4-2666, the whole module is named PC4-21300, because each transfer is 64 bits = 8 bytes, and 2666.</description></item><item><title>Evolution of x86 Memory Organization</title><link>https://cesun.info/cpu/x86/memory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cesun.info/cpu/x86/memory/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article discusses the memory organization from an x86 CPU&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The physical memory, for all CPU designs, can always be modeled as a flat continuous byte array.
Ultimately, the CPU talks to the memory module through the memory bus, and the physical memory - the &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; space can be scanned through by incrementing the numeric value on the address bus. There is no magic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SDRAM Chip Command &amp; Encoding</title><link>https://cesun.info/ee/mem/sdram-cmd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cesun.info/ee/mem/sdram-cmd/</guid><description>NOP: no op REF: REFRESH DES: deselect ACTIVATE(BG, BA, A[17:0]): open a row in a bank encoding:
The ACTIVATE command is used to open (activate) a row in a particular bank for subsequent access. One bank can only have 1 opened row at the same time.
timing restriction:
t_RRD_S (s for short): minimal interval user must wait btwn 2 ACTIVATEs in different bank group. t_RRD_L (l for long): minimal interval user must wait btwn 2 ACTIVATEs in the same bank group.</description></item></channel></rss>
