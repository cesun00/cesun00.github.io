LZ77 was proposed in an age when compression algorithms are studied in the name of encoding and decoding processes. Terminologies were aligned with the classic coding theory. See []

Some definitions are re-phrased.</description></item><item><title>The Unix compress(1) utility</title><link>https://cesun.info/compression/unix-compress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cesun.info/compression/unix-compress/</guid><description>The compress command appeared in 4.3BSD.
