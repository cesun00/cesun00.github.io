Specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s an abuse to refer to DEFLATE as a compression algorithm.
The DEFLATE data format was designed Phil Katz, for version 2 of his PKZIP archiving tool, and later standardized as the RFC 1951.
The most popular and de-facto standard DEFLATE library is the zlib.
Overview A DEFLATE formatted file consists of a sequence of blocks. Each block is comprised of 2 parts: a description of a Huffman tree, followed by the actual compressed data.</description></item><item><title>Zlib and DEFLATE: A Top-Down Introduction</title><link>https://cesun.info/compression/zlib/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cesun.info/compression/zlib/</guid><description>Zlib was authored by Jean-loup Gailly (compression) and Mark Adler (decompression).
Jean-loup is also the primary author of the compression routines of gzip and Info-ZIP&amp;rsquo;s Zip. Mark is also the author of the decompression routines of gzip and Info-ZIP&amp;rsquo;s UnZip. 1# ls -l /usr/lib/libz.* 2-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 130742 Oct 25 08:55 /usr/lib/libz.a 3lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 Oct 25 08:55 /usr/lib/libz.so -&amp;gt; libz.so.1.3 4lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 Oct 25 08:55 /usr/lib/libz.</description></item></channel></rss>
