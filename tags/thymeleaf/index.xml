The previous code generates an XLSX file where heterogeneous information is mixed into a single sheet ponderously and presented as rows whose non-empty columns differ. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to read, and the code is hard to maintain.
Regular order statistics and various warnings are collected during the computation.</description></item></channel></rss>
