A transistor is any device with 3 (or more - see below) terminals where the voltage (thus current) between one pair of terminals controls the current (thus effective resistance) flowing through another pair of terminals. This nice controllability allows a transistor to be used as a switch of current, turned on and off also by electricity.</description></item></channel></rss>
