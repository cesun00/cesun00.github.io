Recently I have been working on a set of scripts that boot some depending services for my web crawler team. The production environment is Windows Server 2013, so the obvious choice is powershell.
and there is no good reason to go back to classic cmd - unless you are a retro-computation hobbiest! :)
Powershell provides nice builtin data structures, and we used a hash table to group all the config in one place for the ease of modification.</description></item></channel></rss>
